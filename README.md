![drbench_banner.png](drbench_banner.png)


**`DRBench`** is the first of its kind benchmark designed to evaluate deep research agents on complex, open-ended **enterprise deep research tasks**.

It tests an agent’s ability to conduct **multi-hop, insight-driven research** across public and private data sources—just like a real enterprise analyst.

## 🧠 Why `drbench`?

- **🔎 Real Deep Research Tasks**  
  Not simple fact lookups. It has tasks like _"What changes should we make to our product roadmap to ensure compliance?"_ which require multi-step reasoning, synthesis, and reporting.

- **🏢 Enterprise Context Grounding**  
  Each task is rooted in realistic **user personas** (e.g., Product Developer) and **organizational settings** (e.g., ServiceNow), for deep understanding and contextual awareness.

- **🧩 Multi-Modal, Multi-Source Reasoning**  
  Agents must search, retrieve, and reason across:
  - Internal chat logs 💬  
  - Cloud file systems 📂  
  - Spreadsheets 📊  
  - PDFs 📄  
  - Websites 🌐  
  - Emails 📧

- **🧠 Insight-Centric Evaluation**  
  Reports are scored based on whether agents extract the **most critical insights** and **properly cite** their sources.
