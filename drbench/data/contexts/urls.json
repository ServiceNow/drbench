      "Tesla's direct-to-consumer model, which bypasses traditional dealerships by selling directly through its own stores, is disrupting the U.S. car dealership system. This approach has influenced other EV startups like Rivian, Lucid, and Polestar to adopt similar strategies, and even legacy automakers are exploring ways to bypass their dealer networks for EV sales.",
      "Volkswagen plans to sell its Scout EVs through a standalone direct-sales brand, and Ford requires dealers to adopt no-haggle pricing for its EVs. In Europe, luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW are shifting to an agency model, allowing customers to order directly from manufacturers, a move opposed by U.S. dealership lobbyists. Florida has enacted a law prohibiting legacy automakers from direct sales while allowing pure EV companies like Tesla to continue this practice.",
      "Car dealers, supported by the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and state associations, view direct sales as a threat and use political influence to uphold franchise model laws that restrict manufacturers from selling or servicing cars directly. While dealers claim they offer consumer benefits like handling warranty claims and local price competition, critics argue they add unnecessary costs and complications. The rise of EVs is intensifying this conflict, as dealerships aim to maintain the traditional model, while new market entrants and consumer trends favor a streamlined, online sales approach."
