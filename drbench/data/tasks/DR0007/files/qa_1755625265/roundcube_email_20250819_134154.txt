Hi Emily and Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. As we kick off Q1, I wanted to touch base regarding our training budget allocation for the upcoming quarter. After our last finance meeting, I can confirm that the training budget for Q1 2024 has been set at $300,000.

This allocation is crucial as we focus on integrating AI-driven analytics and ISTM into our IT service desk processes. With this training investment, we aim to enhance our team's capabilities in leveraging these technologies to minimize our workload and improve response times.

Let me know if you need further details or if there's anything specific you would like to discuss in our next meeting.

John
