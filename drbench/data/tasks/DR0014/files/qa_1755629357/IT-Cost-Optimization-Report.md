# IT Infrastructure Cost Optimization Report

## Introduction

This report aims to provide a thorough analysis of our IT infrastructure costs, focusing on the impact on our employees and the company's overall sustainability goals.

## IT Infrastructure Cost Allocation Framework

Elexion Automotive's IT infrastructure is designed to support our growing global presence. Our framework ensures that costs are accurately allocated across departments, allowing for more effective budgeting and resource allocation. This framework has been in place since 2020, and we've seen significant improvements in our IT cost transparency. With our current infrastructure, we're able to support our team's increasing reliance on digital tools.

## Employee IT Resource Utilization Trends

Our IT resource utilization trends indicate that employees are increasingly relying on cloud-based applications for daily tasks. This shift has led to a 25% decrease in help desk tickets since Q4 2022. As we continue to monitor these trends, we're able to optimize our IT resources and allocate them more efficiently. This, in turn, allows us to provide better support to our employees.

## Quarterly IT Expenditure Breakdown

In Q1 2024, Elexion Automotive's IT expenditures were primarily focused on upgrading our network infrastructure to support our expanding manufacturing facilities. This upgrade has resulted in a 30% increase in network bandwidth. Our IT expenditures are typically allocated across various departments, with the majority going towards software and hardware maintenance.

## IT Cost Reduction Strategies for Future Optimization

To further optimize our IT costs, we're exploring alternative cloud-based solutions for our non-mission-critical applications. This strategy is expected to result in a 15% reduction in IT costs by 2026. Additionally, we're implementing a comprehensive IT asset management system to ensure better visibility and control over our IT assets. This will enable us to make more informed decisions about IT investments and resource allocation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our IT infrastructure costs have a significant impact on our employees and the company's sustainability goals. To optimize these costs, we recommend implementing IT cost reduction strategies and utilizing employee IT resource utilization trends to inform future infrastructure planning.
