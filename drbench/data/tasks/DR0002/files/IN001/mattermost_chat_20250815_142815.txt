@michael.lee:
Hey team, I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion about personalization strategies. As you know, having a robust customer data collection is key to making this work. @samantha.kim, can you give us an update on our customer data collection rate as of Q2 2024?
------------------------------------------------------------

@samantha.kim:
Hi @michael.lee, as of Q2 2024, we've managed to link about 85% of our transactions to customer loyalty accounts. This is a significant improvement from last quarter, and it gives us a solid foundation for implementing personalized marketing campaigns and improving customer engagement.

@david.park:
That's great to hear, @samantha.kim! With that level of data collection, we can start creating more targeted promotions and offers. @michael.lee, should we start brainstorming some ideas for personalized campaigns to roll out in Q3?
