@jane.wong:
Hi team, I've compiled the employee turnover metrics for Q3 2023. Our average turnover rate was 12%, with a peak of 15% in August. This is slightly higher than our target, so we should discuss strategies to improve employee retention.

@michael.lee:
Thanks for sharing this, Jane. Can you provide more context on what might have contributed to the peak in August? Was it related to any specific departments or locations?
------------------------------------------------------------

@jane.wong:
I've analyzed the data, and it seems that the peak in August was mainly due to seasonal fluctuations in our retail stores. We tend to see higher turnover rates during the summer months when students return to school. However, we should still focus on improving our overall retention strategies to minimize the impact of these fluctuations.

We're launching a new employee recognition program to boost morale and engagement. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please share them with me by the end of the week.

@david.kim:
Just a heads up that I've been getting some great feedback from customers about our new online shopping platform. I think we should consider expanding our digital marketing efforts to reach a wider audience.

@michael.lee:
I've been reviewing our sales data, and I think we should consider adjusting our pricing strategy for some of our top-selling products. I'll send out a detailed proposal for discussion at our next meeting.
