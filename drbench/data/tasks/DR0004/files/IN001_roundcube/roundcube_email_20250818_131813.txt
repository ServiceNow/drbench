Hi Sofia,

I'd be happy to provide more insights on the customer behavior and preferences driving the growth in private label sales. Our data suggests that customers are increasingly looking for unique and authentic products that cater to their diverse tastes and preferences. Our private label offerings have been able to meet this demand, resulting in increased customer loyalty and retention.

I agree that we should explore opportunities to build on this momentum. Perhaps we can discuss this further in our next marketing meeting and identify strategies to continue driving growth in this area.

Best regards,
Emily Chen
