Dear David and Sofia,

We are pleased to share the Q3 2024 Sustainability Report for Lee's Market. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, we have made significant progress in increasing our use of renewable energy sources.

As of Q3 2024, approximately 25% of our facilities are now powered by solar energy, resulting in a notable reduction in energy costs. While facility energy sources do not directly impact our competitiveness in the market, our commitment to sustainability is an important aspect of our brand values and appeals to the growing number of environmentally conscious consumers.

The full report is attached for your review. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best regards,
Sustainability Team

Hi Sofia and Sustainability Team,

I agree that highlighting our commitment to sustainability can be a valuable marketing opportunity. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss further and explore ways to incorporate this into our overall marketing strategy.

Sustainability Team, can you please provide some additional data on the environmental impact of our solar-powered facilities? This will be helpful in crafting our messaging.
