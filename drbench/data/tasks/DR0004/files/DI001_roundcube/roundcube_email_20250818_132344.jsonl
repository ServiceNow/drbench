As we continue to grow and expand, it's essential that we monitor our employee retention rates to ensure we're providing the best possible work environment.\n\nOur Q3 2024 employee turnover rate was 12%, with an average tenure of 2.5 years. While this is a slight increase from Q2, it's still within our target range. However, I believe we can do better, and I'd like to discuss some strategies for improving employee retention in our next meeting.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nJason", "folder": "inbox", "read": true, "attachments": []}
