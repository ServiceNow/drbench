Hi Ryan,

I wanted to share some insights from the recent customer satisfaction survey we conducted. Overall, the feedback was positive, but there are a few areas where clients expressed a desire for improvement. I think it might be good for us to discuss how we can address these points in our upcoming meeting. 

Also, Michael suggested a follow-up survey to gauge customer sentiment after implementing changes. I believe that could be beneficial.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
Sarah

Hi Ryan and Sarah,

As we prepare for the budget planning session for the next quarter, I wanted to gather some thoughts on potential marketing initiatives we should prioritize. It would be great to have a clear direction on what we want to focus on to optimize our spending effectively.

Could we possibly set up a brief call later this week to discuss this? I think it would help to align our strategies before the planning meeting.

Thanks!

Best,
Michael

Message Body:

Hi Ryan and Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some insights we've gathered from our recent patient surveys regarding their preferences for accessing virtual healthcare services. As we strategize for Q3 2024, it’s crucial to consider these trends.

Interestingly, our data shows that 80% of patients prefer mobile access for their telehealth needs. This underscores the necessity for us to enhance our mobile web presence and ensure that our digital platforms are optimized for a seamless mobile experience.

I believe this insight should guide our content marketing strategy, emphasizing mobile-friendly resources and services. Let’s discuss how we can implement these findings in our upcoming campaigns.

Best,
Michael

Hi Michael,

Thanks for sharing this valuable insight! The fact that 80% of patients prefer mobile access is significant and definitely highlights the need for us to pivot our resources accordingly.

I suggest we brainstorm some content ideas that specifically target mobile users, such as short videos, infographics, and quick-access guides. This could help us attract more digital-first patients who are increasingly reliant on their smartphones.

Let’s set up a meeting to discuss our next steps.

Best,
Ryan
