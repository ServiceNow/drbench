            "content": "In Q4 2024, our platform maintenance team resolved 95% of all technical issues within a 2-hour window, resulting in a 25% reduction in downtime compared to the same period in 2023. This improvement can be attributed to our investment in a new incident management tool, which streamlined our troubleshooting process. The new tool also enabled our IT department to identify and address potential issues proactively, reducing the overall number of support tickets by 15%. As a result, we were able to reallocate 5% of our maintenance budget to other areas of the business.",

            "content": "Our cloud services expenditure analysis revealed that 60% of our total cloud spend in Q2 2024 was attributed to data storage and processing. This was largely driven by the increasing demand for our virtual healthcare services, which resulted in a 30% growth in patient data. To optimize our cloud spend, we implemented a new data compression algorithm, which reduced our storage costs by 10%. We also renegotiated our contract with our cloud provider, securing a 5% discount on our total cloud spend.",
