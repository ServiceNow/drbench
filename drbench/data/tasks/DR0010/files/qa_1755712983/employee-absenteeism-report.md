## Introduction

As the HR Manager at MediConn Solutions, it is essential to monitor employee absenteeism and well-being trends to ensure the overall health and productivity of our workforce. This report aims to provide insights into employee sick leave patterns and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing these trends, we can develop targeted strategies to support employee well-being and maintain a healthy work environment. This report will present key findings and recommendations for Q3 2025.

## Work-Life Balance Initiatives and Employee Engagement

In Q2 2025, our HR department launched a comprehensive wellness program, which included bi-weekly meditation sessions, team-building activities, and access to on-site fitness classes. The program aimed to promote a healthy work-life balance, improve employee morale, and increase job satisfaction. By the end of Q2, 75% of employees had participated in at least one wellness activity, and our internal surveys showed a 15% increase in overall employee engagement. This initiative has become a staple of our company culture and continues to receive positive feedback from employees.

## Average Duration of Employee Sick Leave in Q3

Our company has been monitoring industry trends and benchmarking our policies against those of our competitors. According to a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational Health, the average cost of absenteeism in the healthcare industry is estimated to be around $1,200 per employee per year. In response to this data, we have been exploring strategies to reduce absenteeism and improve employee health, including offering on-site health screenings and providing access to mental health resources. By investing in our employees' health and well-being, we aim to reduce the financial burden of absenteeism and improve overall productivity.

## Mental Health Support Services Utilization Rates

As part of our ongoing efforts to support employee mental health, we partnered with a leading mental health services provider to offer confidential counseling sessions to all employees. Between January and June 2025, a total of 120 employees took advantage of this service, with an average of 6 sessions per employee. Our internal surveys have shown a significant reduction in stress and anxiety levels among employees who have utilized this service, and we plan to continue offering it as part of our comprehensive benefits package. By investing in our employees' mental health, we aim to create a healthier and more productive work environment.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the data presented in this report highlights the importance of addressing employee absenteeism and well-being in our organization. By implementing targeted strategies and support services, we can reduce employee sick leave durations and promote a healthier work environment. Recommendations from this report will be used to inform our HR policies and employee wellness initiatives. Next steps will involve collaborating with department managers to develop and implement these strategies.
