As part of our ongoing efforts to refine our digital marketing strategy, I\u2019ve pulled together the patient demographic data for Q2 2024. \n\nThe breakdown shows that 60% of our patients are female and 40% are male. This data is crucial as we look to optimize our website and content strategy to attract more digital-first patients. Understanding our demographic can guide us in tailoring our messaging, selecting the right imagery, and focusing our advertising efforts more effectively.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss how we can leverage this insight in our next marketing meeting. It seems that while the demographics are informative, we should also consider other factors such as user experience and accessibility to ensure we are meeting the needs of our diverse patient base.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDavid\n", "folder": "inbox", "read": true, "attachments": []}
