Subject: Q2 2024 Patient Demographic Breakdown
Folder: inbox | Status: Read

Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Ryan and Jessica,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to refine our digital marketing strategy, I’ve pulled together the patient demographic data for Q2 2024. 

The breakdown shows that 60% of our patients are female and 40% are male. This data is crucial as we look to optimize our website and content strategy to attract more digital-first patients. Understanding our demographic can guide us in tailoring our messaging, selecting the right imagery, and focusing our advertising efforts more effectively.

Let’s discuss how we can leverage this insight in our next marketing meeting. It seems that while the demographics are informative, we should also consider other factors such as user experience and accessibility to ensure we are meeting the needs of our diverse patient base.

Best regards,

David

Hi David,

Thanks for the update on the demographics. The 60/40 split is interesting and gives us a lot to think about. I agree that we should incorporate this data into our content strategy. 

Additionally, I’d like to explore how we can enhance our digital presence. Perhaps we can focus on creating more content that resonates with our female patient demographic, given their higher participation. We can also analyze what topics are most appealing to them.

I’ll prepare some ideas for our meeting next week.

Best,

Ryan

Hi Ryan and David,

Great points on the demographics. I think it’s also vital that we ensure our website's navigation is intuitive for all users, especially since we know that 60% of our patients are female. 

We might want to consider user testing with representatives from our patient demographics to gather insights on their experience. This could help us identify any barriers and improve our overall digital presence.

Looking forward to discussing this further!

Best,

Jessica
