# Energy Consumption Report Q2 2025

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of energy consumption costs for Q2 2025, highlighting key trends and insights.

## Energy Management Strategy

Our energy management strategy has been designed to optimize energy usage across our facilities, with a focus on data-driven decision making. To achieve this, we have implemented a comprehensive energy management system that tracks and analyzes energy consumption in real-time. This allows us to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about energy-efficient solutions. By leveraging advanced data analytics and energy optimization techniques, we aim to reduce our energy consumption by 15% by the end of 2026.

## Facility Energy Consumption Trends

Our facility energy consumption has historically been influenced by various factors, including seasonal changes, equipment upgrades, and changes in production levels. By analyzing these trends, we can better predict and prepare for fluctuations in energy demand, ensuring a more efficient and cost-effective energy strategy. Our data shows that energy consumption during peak summer months increases by 12% compared to average consumption levels.

## Cost Allocation Methodologies

At Elexion Automotive, we employ a cost allocation methodology that ensures accurate and transparent tracking of energy-related expenses. This allows us to make informed decisions about energy-efficient solutions and optimize our energy consumption. Our cost allocation methodology is based on a combination of industry standards and internal best practices, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all facilities.

## Quarterly Performance Metrics

Our quarterly performance metrics are designed to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across various business areas, including energy management. These metrics enable us to monitor progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions. In the last quarter, we achieved a 9% reduction in energy consumption compared to the same period the previous year.

## Energy Efficiency Initiatives

Elexion Automotive has a long history of investing in energy-efficient solutions, with a focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility. Our energy efficiency initiatives are designed to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste, and promote a culture of sustainability. In recent years, we have implemented various energy-efficient solutions, including LED lighting and energy-efficient HVAC systems.

## Facility Energy Consumption Insights

Our facility energy consumption insights are designed to provide actionable intelligence on energy consumption patterns, helping us to optimize energy usage and reduce costs. By analyzing consumption patterns, we can identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about energy-efficient solutions. Our data analysis suggests that energy consumption during off-peak hours is significantly lower than peak hours, indicating opportunities for optimization.

## Conclusion

This report summarizes key findings and recommendations for optimizing energy consumption costs, with a focus on long-term sustainability and cost savings
