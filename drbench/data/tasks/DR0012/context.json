            "J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 Initial Quality Study reveals that new EVs average 266 problems per 100 vehicles in the first 90 days, compared to the industry average of 195 PP100, with issues primarily related to software and user experience rather than core mechanics. The study highlights that the problems are largely due to high-tech features and infotainment systems, not drivetrain failures.",
            "Tesla's removal of traditional turn-signal and wiper stalks in favor of touch controls on newer models led to increased owner complaints and lower quality ratings due to the unintuitive interface. Additionally, misunderstandings about advanced driver-assist features, such as alerts for rear-seat reminders or automatic braking, contribute to perceived problems among EV owners. These issues underscore the importance of user-centric design and comprehensive customer training in enhancing EV quality assurance.",
            "Infotainment and connectivity systems are the leading sources of initial problems in modern vehicles, particularly EVs, with J.D. Power data indicating \"features, controls, and displays\" issues are 30% higher for electric cars. Common complaints include unreliable navigation, smartphone app glitches, and difficulties with touch-screen menus, with phone integration issues like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto dropouts being prevalent. Brands like Ram and Lexus, which prioritize simplicity and robust design, scored better in quality, highlighting the importance of rigorous software testing and user-friendly controls in automotive quality assurance for EVs."
