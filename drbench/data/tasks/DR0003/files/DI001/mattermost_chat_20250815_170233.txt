@sarahkim:
Hi team, I wanted to share some updates on our employee retention metrics. As of Q3 2023, our employee retention rate averaged 85% with a 5% increase year-over-year. This is a great indication that our employee engagement initiatives are paying off. It's also worth noting that these metrics do not address customer loyalty programs, but rather focus on our internal employee retention efforts.

@david.lee:
Thanks for sharing, Sarah! It's great to see our employee retention efforts are yielding positive results. Can you share some insights on what specific initiatives contributed to this increase?

@sarahkim:
We've seen a significant impact from our employee recognition and reward programs, as well as our training and development initiatives. These efforts have helped to boost employee satisfaction and engagement, leading to increased retention rates.
