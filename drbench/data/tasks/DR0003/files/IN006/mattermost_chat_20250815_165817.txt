@ktran:
Hi team, I've finished analyzing the Q2 2024 loyalty program metrics. One key takeaway is that our loyalty program members had a $6 average order value increase with 10% growth. This suggests that our targeted marketing efforts are paying off and driving sales growth.

@david.lee:
Thanks for sharing this insight, Kevin. This is great news for our loyalty program. Can you also share some recommendations on how we can leverage this momentum to further enhance customer engagement?

@ktran:
Based on our analysis, I recommend we continue to personalize our marketing efforts and offer more targeted promotions to our loyalty program members. We should also consider implementing a tiered rewards system to incentivize customers to make more purchases.
