# Q2 2024 IT Performance Review Report

## Introduction

As the IT Operations Manager at Lee's Market, I am responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of our IT systems. This report provides an overview of our IT performance in Q2 2024, highlighting key areas of focus and opportunities for improvement. The purpose of this report is to inform stakeholders of our IT system performance and provide recommendations for future enhancements. By reviewing our IT performance, we can optimize our systems to better support our business operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## IT Service Management Process Review

As part of our ongoing effort to improve IT service management, we conducted a thorough review of our incident management process in Q1 2024. The review revealed that 85% of incidents were resolved within the target timeframe, exceeding our goal of 80%. Our IT team also implemented a new escalation procedure, which has resulted in a 20% reduction in mean time to resolve (MTTR) for critical incidents. We will continue to monitor and refine our processes to ensure optimal IT service delivery.

## System Uptime and Downtime Analysis

Our IT team has been working closely with the operations department to analyze system performance during peak shopping seasons. We observed a 15% increase in online transactions during the Lunar New Year period, resulting in a 5% increase in server utilization. To ensure system stability, we are planning to upgrade our server infrastructure by the end of Q3 2024. This upgrade will enable us to better handle increased traffic during peak periods.

## IT Incident Response and Resolution

We have implemented a new IT incident response plan, which includes a clear escalation procedure and defined roles and responsibilities. The plan was tested during a recent tabletop exercise, and the results showed a 30% improvement in response time compared to the previous exercise. Our IT team is also working on developing a comprehensive incident response playbook, which will be completed by the end of Q2 2024. This will enable us to respond more effectively to IT incidents and minimize downtime.

## Change Management and Implementation

As part of our change management process, we have implemented a new change advisory board (CAB) to review and approve all changes to our IT systems. The CAB has reviewed 25 changes since its inception in Q1 2024, and has rejected 5 changes due to potential risks to system stability. We are also working on developing a comprehensive change management policy, which will be completed by the end of Q3 2024. This will enable us to better manage changes to our IT systems and minimize disruptions to business operations.

## Future IT Infrastructure Development Plans

We are planning to upgrade our IT infrastructure to support the growth of our e-commerce platform. The upgrade will include the implementation of a new content delivery network (CDN) and the deployment of additional servers to support increased traffic. We expect the upgrade to be completed by the end of Q4 2024, and anticipate a 25% improvement in website performance. This will enable us to better support our online customers and improve their overall shopping experience.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our Q2 2024 IT performance review highlights areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. By addressing these areas, we can optimize our IT systems to better support our business operations and improve customer satisfaction. Recommendations from this report will be used to inform our IT strategy and prioritize future enhancements. By implementing these changes, we can ensure our IT systems continue to support the growth and success of Lee's Market.
