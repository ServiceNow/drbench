@emilychen:
Hi team, I wanted to share our Q2 2024 supplier diversity metrics. We've seen a significant increase in minority-owned supply chain partners, reaching 18% with a 12% increase annually. This growth is a result of our targeted efforts to promote diversity among our suppliers. I'll be sharing a detailed report soon, but I wanted to give you all a sneak peek. Great job, everyone!

@jameskim:
Hi Emily, thanks for sharing! I'm glad to see our efforts paying off. Can you also share some insights on how this growth has impacted our loyalty program effectiveness? I'm curious to know if there's a correlation.

@emilychen:
Hi James, our supplier diversity metrics don't directly address loyalty program effectiveness, but we can definitely explore that in our next analysis. For now, let's focus on celebrating this win and continuing to promote diversity among our suppliers.
