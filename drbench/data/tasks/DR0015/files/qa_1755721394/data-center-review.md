# Q1 2025 Data Center Performance Review

## Introduction

As we continue to accelerate the transition to zero-emission transportation, our reliance on high-performing data centers becomes increasingly critical. This report provides an overview of our data center performance in Q1 2025, highlighting key areas for improvement and opportunities for growth. Our goal is to ensure seamless operations and minimize downtime, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of our business. This review aims to inform strategic decisions and optimize our data center infrastructure.

## Data Center Infrastructure Resilience and Redundancy

To ensure seamless operations, our data center infrastructure is designed with N+2 redundancy, providing an additional layer of backup systems to mitigate potential failures. This strategic investment has allowed us to maintain a consistent level of service, even during the 2023 facility upgrade, which involved the replacement of 450 servers over a period of six weeks. The upgrade was successfully completed by our IT team in collaboration with the facilities management department, with minimal disruption to our business operations. Overall, this forward-thinking approach has enabled Elexion Automotive to maintain a strong reputation for reliability in the industry.

## Average Downtime and Mean Time to Recovery Analysis

Our IT department has been working closely with the compliance team to develop a comprehensive framework for aligning our data center operations with the latest industry standards, including the recently updated ISO 27001. This collaborative effort has involved a thorough review of our incident response protocols, resulting in the implementation of new procedures that have improved our overall responsiveness to system issues. For instance, we have reduced the average time to initiate system backups by 30% over the past quarter, through process improvements and targeted training for our IT staff. These enhancements have contributed to a stronger overall posture for our data center operations.

## Data Center Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Initiatives

As part of Elexion Automotive's ongoing commitment to sustainability, our data center has been actively exploring opportunities to reduce its environmental footprint. In 2024, we successfully implemented a new cooling system that utilizes advanced air-side economization, resulting in a 25% reduction in energy consumption during peak summer months. This initiative has not only decreased our energy costs but also enabled us to better align our operations with the company's overall mission to accelerate the transition to zero-emission transportation. Furthermore, our data center has been recognized as a leader in energy efficiency, with a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating of 1.38, significantly lower than the industry average.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our Q1 2025 data center performance review highlights the need for continued investment in infrastructure resilience and redundancy. By prioritizing these initiatives, we can minimize downtime and ensure seamless operations. Our team will work closely with stakeholders to implement these recommendations and track progress. By doing so, we can maintain our competitive edge and drive business growth while upholding our commitment to sustainability.
