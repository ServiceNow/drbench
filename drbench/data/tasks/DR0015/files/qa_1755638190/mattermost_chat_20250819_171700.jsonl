For Q2 2024, we totaled $1.2 million, which reflects a 15% increase from the previous quarter. This increase is primarily due to the expansion of our training programs to better support our customer service team and enhance overall employee skills. It's important to note that these training costs are not directly related to customer trust or after-sales support, but rather focus on internal development. Let me know if you have any questions or need further details!", "create_at": 1680000000000}}
