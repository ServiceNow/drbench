@ryan.thompson:
Hey team, I wanted to discuss the latest customer feedback report. Are we looking at any specific trends that we should address in our next meeting?

@julia.martinez:
Hi team, I've been compiling the data for our compliance audits in Q2 2024. The average time we’ve seen for completion is around 45 days, with some taking up to a maximum of 60 days. It's important to note that these durations are not directly related to enhancing customer trust in our services, but they do impact our overall operational efficiency. Let’s keep this in mind as we plan our upcoming audits.
