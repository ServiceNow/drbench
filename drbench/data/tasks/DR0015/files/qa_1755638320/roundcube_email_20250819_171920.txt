Hi Ryan and Jessica,

I wanted to provide an update regarding our facility maintenance budget for Q2 2024. After reviewing our financial plans and expenditures, I've confirmed that our budget for this quarter is set at $500,000.

While this may not directly influence our after-sales support strategies, maintaining our facilities in optimal condition is crucial for ensuring that our customer service teams can operate efficiently. This way, we can focus on improving customer trust through exceptional care while keeping costs manageable.

Let me know if you need further details or if there's anything specific you would like to discuss regarding our customer service initiatives.
