## Marketing Budget Allocation and ROI Analysis

Our marketing team conducted a thorough review of the FY2023 budget allocation in November 2023, focusing on ROI-driven initiatives.

The review also highlighted opportunities for cost savings through vendor consolidation. By implementing these changes, we expect to achieve a 10% reduction in marketing expenses by Q1 2025.

## Impact of Electric Vehicle Incentives on Marketing Strategy

The recent extension of federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases has led to a significant increase in customer inquiries. Our sales team reported a 30% rise in test drive requests between January and March 2024, with 75% of these requests coming from first-time EV buyers. In response, we have adjusted our marketing messaging to emphasize the benefits of EV ownership and the available incentives. This shift in strategy is expected to drive sales growth in the coming quarters.

## Annual Marketing Costs Breakdown by Channel

A recent industry benchmarking study revealed that the average automotive manufacturer allocates 55% of its marketing budget to digital channels.

However, we are exploring opportunities to increase our online presence through targeted social media campaigns and influencer partnerships.
