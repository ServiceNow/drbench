Subject: Quarterly Logistics Cost Report
Folder: inbox | Status: Read

Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Ryan and Jessica,

I hope this message finds you well. As we reviewed our operational metrics for Q2, I wanted to share the logistics costs that have been finalized. For Q2 of 2024, our logistics costs totaled $2 million, reflecting a 5% increase from Q1. 

While logistics costs are often seen as a separate component of our operations, they play a critical role in our after-sales support strategy. Efficient logistics can enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring timely deliveries of parts and services, which ultimately boosts customer trust in our brand.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further breakdowns of these figures.

Best,
Michael

I’ll discuss this with my team to see how we can align our customer service efforts with these logistics improvements to maximize customer trust.

Thanks again!
