            "California's Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) rule requires 35% of new vehicles sold to be zero-emission by 2026, reaching 100% by 2035, with stringent EV standards. EV manufacturers must include OBD-II diagnostics, display battery \"state of health\" to drivers, and ensure that by 2030, EV batteries retain at least 80% of their range for 10 years or 150,000 miles.",
            "The U.S. EPA's proposed 2027+ emissions standards suggest automakers will need approximately 67% EV sales by 2032 to meet CO2 limits. The proposal includes EV-specific durability rules, requiring battery health monitors and ensuring light-duty EVs maintain 80% battery capacity for up to 5 years/62,000 miles and 70% for up to 8 years/100,000 miles."
