Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Sofia and Linda,

I wanted to provide you with a quick update regarding our electric vehicle models and their compliance with the upcoming ACC II standards. As we continue to refine our product offerings, it's crucial that we align our production timelines with these regulatory requirements.

After reviewing our current development pipeline, I’m pleased to report that we anticipate five EV models will meet the ACC II standards by Q2 2026. This positions us well in terms of both compliance and market readiness, allowing us to reassure our customers about the durability and warranty guarantees for our batteries amidst evolving regulations.

Please let me know if you need further details or if there are any specific areas you’d like me to look into further.

Best,
Michael

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Hi Michael and Sofia,

I agree with Sofia—this is an encouraging update! Meeting the ACC II standards with five models is a strong step towards our sustainability goals. 

Let’s ensure that our design teams are fully briefed on these compliance requirements so we can address any potential challenges early. I’ll coordinate a meeting where we can discuss this further, including any additional resources we might need to stay compliant.

Hi Sofia and Linda,

I hope you both are doing great. I reviewed the results from the recent customer satisfaction survey, and I wanted to share some insights. Overall, customers seem to be happy with our vehicles, but there are a few areas we can improve upon:

- Charging infrastructure feedback

I believe it would be beneficial for us to discuss how we can address these concerns. Let’s bring this up in our next team meeting.

Thanks!
