# Q1 2025 IT Security Incident Report

## Introduction

As the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at Elexion Automotive, I am responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of our IT systems. This report provides an overview of our IT security posture for Q1 2025, highlighting key trends and areas for improvement. The purpose of this report is to inform stakeholders of our IT security performance and provide recommendations for future enhancements. The insights and recommendations presented in this report are based on data collected from our IT security incident management system.

## Cybersecurity Threat Landscape and Emerging Trends

Our threat intelligence team has been monitoring a 25% increase in phishing attempts targeting the automotive industry since Q3 2024. This uptick is attributed to the rising demand for electric vehicles and the subsequent growth in online customer engagement. As a result, we have enhanced our employee training programs to focus on social engineering tactics and improved email filtering systems. These proactive measures will help safeguard our systems against increasingly sophisticated threats.

## IT Security Incident Response and Remediation Efforts

In accordance with our incident response plan, the IT department conducts bi-annual tabletop exercises to ensure seamless communication and coordination among stakeholders. These exercises have resulted in an average response time reduction of 30 minutes over the past year. Our incident response team has also been working closely with the compliance department to ensure that our procedures align with the latest NIST guidelines. This collaboration enables us to maintain a robust incident response framework.

## Quarterly IT Security Performance Metrics and Analysis

Our vulnerability management program has successfully remediated 95% of identified vulnerabilities within the recommended timeframe of 30 days. This achievement is a testament to the team's dedication to maintaining a secure environment. Additionally, our security awareness program has seen a significant increase in employee participation, with 85% of employees completing the mandatory training modules. These metrics demonstrate our commitment to maintaining a robust security posture.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our Q1 2025 IT security performance indicates a need for continued vigilance and improvement in our incident response and remediation efforts. I recommend that we prioritize the implementation of additional security controls and enhance our employee training programs to address emerging threats. By taking a proactive approach to IT security, we can minimize the risk of security incidents and protect our business operations. I will provide regular updates on our IT security performance and progress towards our security goals.
