Subject: Update on Compliance and Production Timeline

Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Michael and Linda,

I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to navigate the evolving ACC II regulations, I wanted to provide an update on our compliance testing for the new vehicle models.

Currently, the focus is on ensuring that our battery systems meet the new durability standards without compromising production timelines. With the target set for 2035, it’s crucial that we balance these requirements effectively.

Additionally, regarding the IT infrastructure, I’ve confirmed that the upgrade budget for Q4 2023 is set at $2 million. This investment is essential for enhancing our compliance testing capabilities, which indirectly supports our goals for battery durability and warranty guarantees. It’s important to note that while this budget allocation is significant, it does not directly affect our EV battery durability and compliance requirements.

Let’s discuss this further in our next meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best,
Sofia
