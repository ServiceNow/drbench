Hi Liam and Michael,

I wanted to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to enhance patient engagement through the new CRM solutions we've been evaluating. As discussed in our last meeting, improving patient engagement is key to boosting retention rates.

Based on our analysis and projections, we anticipate a patient retention rate of approximately 80% by Q3 2025. This aligns with our goal to implement more personalized communication strategies and streamlined patient interactions.

Let’s keep pushing to refine these strategies and leverage the new CRM tools effectively. I believe this will significantly enhance our patient relationships moving forward.

Best,
Sarah

Hi Liam,

Absolutely! The new CRM solutions we’re considering offer features like automated patient follow-ups, integrated health tracking, and personalized communication templates. These tools will help us engage patients more effectively and ensure they feel valued, which is crucial for retention.

Let’s schedule a quick call to further discuss how we can implement these features in our outreach efforts.
