Hi Liam and Mike,

I wanted to share some feedback regarding the training session we had last week on our new patient management system. Overall, I think the session was quite informative, and I appreciate everyone’s participation.

However, I did notice that a few team members had questions about the reporting features. I suggest we might want to schedule a follow-up session to address these concerns. What do you both think?

Thanks!
Sarah

Hello Liam and Sarah,

As we approach the end of the year, I think it’s crucial we start discussing our budget planning for Q1 of 2024. We’ll need to consider our projected expenses, potential new hires, and any upcoming projects that may require funding.

Would you be available for a brainstorming session later this week? I believe it would be beneficial to gather our thoughts early on.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Subject: Q2 2024 IT Support Metrics and CRM Strategy Discussion
Folder: inbox | Status: Read

Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Liam and Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for our quarterly review, I wanted to share some insights on our IT support metrics, which might be helpful as we discuss potential CRM solutions to enhance patient engagement.

In Q2 2024, the average resolution time for IT support tickets was 24 hours. This is a significant improvement from previous quarters, and it demonstrates our commitment to providing timely support, which can directly influence patient satisfaction and retention.

Understanding this metric is crucial as we consider how new CRM solutions can integrate with our existing support framework to further streamline patient interactions. If we can reduce resolution times even more, we could see a direct positive impact on patient engagement.

Let’s make sure to incorporate this data into our upcoming strategy discussions. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Mike

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sharing the IT support metrics. It's great to see the average resolution time improving to 24 hours! This is definitely a positive step and can be leveraged in our pitches to potential clients.

When discussing new CRM solutions, we should focus on tools that enhance communication channels, potentially reducing the need for support tickets and improving overall patient experiences. I’ll gather some insights on trending CRM solutions expected in 2025 that could align with our goals.

Looking forward to our discussion!

Best,
Liam

Hi Liam and Mike,

I appreciate the input on the IT support metrics. The 24-hour resolution time is indeed a strong indicator of our operational efficiency. 

Regarding CRM solutions, I suggest we explore options that incorporate AI to provide proactive support and improve patient engagement. This could help us further lower support tickets and enhance our service delivery.

Let’s compile a list of potential CRM platforms to discuss in our next meeting.

Best,
Sarah

Hi Mike and Sarah,

I did some research on the CRM solutions expected in 2025, focusing on those that can enhance patient engagement and retention. I found several promising platforms that utilize predictive analytics and personalized communication strategies.

I believe integrating these systems with our existing IT support framework will not only help maintain our 24-hour resolution time but could also significantly improve patient satisfaction. Let’s finalize our list and prepare for the strategy session next week.

Best,
Liam
