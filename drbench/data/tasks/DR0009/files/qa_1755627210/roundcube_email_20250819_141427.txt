Hi Liam and Jessica,

As we start planning our budget for Q1 2025, I wanted to touch base regarding our employee training costs. Based on our previous training initiatives and the projected needs for the upcoming year, we are estimating the total training expenses to be around $200,000. 

This figure includes costs for both new onboarding processes and upskilling current employees to better utilize our CRM solutions, which will also enhance patient engagement and retention. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need further details as we move forward with the budget.

Best,
Michael

Hi Michael,

Thanks for the update on the training costs. The $200,000 projection seems reasonable given where we stand with CRM integrations. I think it’s crucial for us to invest in this area to improve not only our internal processes but also the overall patient experience.

Hi Liam,

Absolutely, I agree that the training will be pivotal. The focus will be on familiarizing our teams with the new CRM tools that are expected to launch in 2025. We aim to ensure that every employee is well-equipped to use these tools effectively, which should lead to better patient engagement metrics and retention rates.

I’ll put together a more detailed plan on how the training will be structured and its direct benefits regarding patient interaction.

Thanks,
Michael
