Hi Liam and Michael,

As we start planning for next year, I wanted to touch base regarding our annual marketing budget. Given our focus on enhancing patient engagement and retention through innovative CRM solutions, it’s crucial we align our budget accordingly.

I’ve been discussing this with the finance team, and we anticipate that our annual marketing budget for 2025 will be around $1 million. This allocation will help us explore new CRM technologies and strategies that can effectively improve our patient interactions.

Let’s make sure we leverage this budget to its fullest potential, especially in relation to upcoming CRM trends that can bolster our efforts.

Best,
Sarah
