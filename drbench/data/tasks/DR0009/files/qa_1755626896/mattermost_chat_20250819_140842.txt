@mike.johnson:
Hey team, as we prepare our projections for the upcoming quarters, I've reviewed our IT infrastructure costs. Based on our current contracts and projected usage, I estimate that our IT costs will reach approximately $1.2 million by Q3 2025. It's important to note that these costs are primarily associated with maintaining our systems and do not correlate with CRM effectiveness or our patient retention strategies. Let's ensure we're optimizing our resources to manage this effectively.
