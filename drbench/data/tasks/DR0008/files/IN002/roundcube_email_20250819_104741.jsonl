This figure encompasses not just direct remediation expenses but also the indirect costs related to reputational damage and potential loss of patient trust.\n\nGiven the current regulatory landscape, it\u2019s crucial for us to evaluate what new measures we can implement to enhance our defenses against such breaches in the future.
