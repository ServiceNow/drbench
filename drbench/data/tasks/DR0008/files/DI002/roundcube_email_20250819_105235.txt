Subject: Q2 2024 Patient Satisfaction Metrics
Folder: inbox | Status: Read

Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi Brian and Jessica,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share the latest patient satisfaction metrics for Q2 2024. I'm pleased to report that our patient satisfaction rate has improved to 87%, up from 82% last year. This positive trend is encouraging as we continue to enhance our virtual healthcare services.

As we assess the impact of third-party data breaches, it’s worth noting that maintaining high patient satisfaction is crucial for our continued success and compliance with upcoming regulations. Given the sensitive nature of patient data, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures will be vital in preserving trust.

Let’s discuss this further in our next meeting and explore how we can align our cybersecurity strategies with our patient satisfaction goals.

Best regards,
Michael

Let’s come with ideas on how to enhance our security protocols and maintain this upward trend in patient satisfaction.
