I just finished the initial mockups for the new patient dashboard. Would love feedback before we move on to development. Can we set a time to review them together?

Has anyone had a chance to review the customer feedback from last quarter? It might provide valuable insights for our current project.

I’d like to propose we allocate more resources towards our network security upgrades. With the increase in remote services, it’s crucial we stay ahead.

@mark_johnson:
Hey team, as we continue to ramp up our projects, I wanted to share some updates on our staffing. We hired 30 new employees in Q3 2025, which should significantly bolster our development capacity. This will help us meet the increasing demand for our virtual healthcare services. Let’s make sure to onboard them effectively to maintain our project timelines.

@brian_smith:
That's great to hear, Mark! With the new hires, we should also prioritize training them on our security protocols. It's crucial they understand how to protect patient data, especially since our hiring metrics can impact our cybersecurity strategy. Let’s ensure that they’re well-versed in compliance and security from day one.
