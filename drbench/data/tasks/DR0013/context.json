            "In 2024, researchers exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in connected cars by remotely exploiting a flaw in Kia's online services, allowing them to control functions on any Kia vehicle made since 2013, and similarly hijacking certain Subaru models. These incidents highlight the significant risks to driver safety and data privacy posed by modern vehicles, often referred to as \"computers on wheels.\" Automakers must address these cybersecurity threats to protect their customers.",
            "Cyberattacks on vehicles and automotive IT systems have resulted in estimated financial losses of $22.5 billion, including $20 billion from data breaches and $1.9 billion from operational downtime. Vulnerabilities such as unsecured wireless interfaces and physical access points are being targeted, prompting manufacturers to enhance cybersecurity measures with improved encryption, authentication, and intrusion detection systems.",
            "The rise of autonomous and connected EVs introduces significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly with V2X communications and over-the-air updates. The European Union has enacted strict automotive cybersecurity rules, while the U.S. relies on voluntary guidelines. Automakers must collaborate with governments and tech partners to integrate cybersecurity as a core aspect of vehicle safety."
