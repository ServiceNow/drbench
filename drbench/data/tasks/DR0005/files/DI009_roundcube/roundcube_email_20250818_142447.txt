Looking forward to seeing your proposal, Michael. I suggest we also include metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of this training on customer interactions with the chatbot. Knowing that our training budget increased to $450,000, we have a solid foundation to build on and ensure our employees are well-equipped to meet the needs of our centennial shoppers.

Let’s reconvene next week to finalize our approach.
