@skim:
Hi David, I had a customer complaint about our return policy. They felt it was unclear and caused some confusion. Should we revisit our policy and make some adjustments?

Just a heads up that the IT team will be conducting some system maintenance this weekend, which may cause some disruptions to our inventory management system.

Great point Sophia, I think it's time we review our return policy and make some changes. Can you work on drafting an updated version and I'll review it?

Hello team, I'd like to share our Q3 2024 new store openings report. We've successfully opened 12 new locations across the US, with 4 in California, 3 in New York, and 5 in Texas. This brings our total store count to 75 locations. Great job to everyone involved in the expansion efforts!

We opened 2 locations in Houston, 2 in Dallas, and 1 in Austin. All of these locations are now fully operational and receiving great customer feedback. I'll send over the detailed report to you via email.
