Hey team, just wanted to share some key metrics for our customer service performance in 2024 so far. We're seeing an average of 50,000 customer queries per month, which is up 15% from last year.

That's really helpful to know, David. Do you think this increase in queries will impact our plans to implement chatbots for customer support?
