I've been noticing an increase in customer complaints about our online ordering system. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Should we escalate it to the IT department?

@jwang:
Hi team, I've finished analyzing our Q3 2024 customer data. One key takeaway is that 25% of our customers are now centennial shoppers. This demographic shift has significant implications for our marketing and customer service strategies, particularly in regards to chatbot features and functionality.

@david.thompson:
Thanks for sharing this insight, Jenny. Knowing that a quarter of our customers are centennial shoppers will definitely help us tailor our chatbot to meet their needs. Can you share more about the specific preferences and behaviors of this demographic?
------------------------------------------------------------

@jwang:
From our analysis, we see that centennial shoppers are more likely to engage with chatbots that offer personalized recommendations, streamlined checkout processes, and seamless integration with social media platforms. They also prioritize sustainability and social responsibility when making purchasing decisions.
