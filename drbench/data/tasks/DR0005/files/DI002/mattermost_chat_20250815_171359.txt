@jlee:
Hi team, I've finished analyzing our Q2 2024 energy consumption costs. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, I'm pleased to report that we've seen a slight decrease in energy usage compared to Q1. Our total energy consumption cost for Q2 2024 came out to be $850,000. This is a great step towards our sustainability goals, and I'll be working on identifying areas for further improvement.

@swang:
Thanks for the update, Jason. It's great to see our efforts paying off. Can you provide more details on the areas that contributed to the decrease in energy usage?

@jlee:
I'd be happy to provide more insights. The main contributors to the decrease were the LED lighting upgrades we implemented in our warehouses and the improved energy efficiency of our new refrigeration systems. I'll be working on a more detailed report, but feel free to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime.
