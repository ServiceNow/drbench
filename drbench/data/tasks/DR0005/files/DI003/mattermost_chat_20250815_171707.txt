Hello everyone, I wanted to follow up on the new inventory management system implementation. The training sessions are scheduled for next week. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

@lwong:
Hi David, I've been going over the customer satisfaction survey results and I noticed a trend of customers requesting more organic options. Should we consider adding more organic products to our inventory?

Great point, Lily. I think adding more organic options would be a great idea. Let's discuss this further in our meeting tomorrow and see what we can do.

@achan:
Hi team, just a reminder that our Q2 2025 risk management report is due soon. I've started compiling the data and wanted to share some key stats. Our workers' compensation claims rate was 2.5% with a total payout of $120,000. This is slightly lower than Q1, but still an area for improvement. I'll be working on the full report and recommendations for reducing claims in the coming weeks.
------------------------------------------------------------

[2023-06-09 17:10:00] #operations:risk-management
@david.thompson:
@achan thanks for the update. Can you also include some analysis on the causes of the claims and potential strategies for reducing them? That would be really helpful for our team.
------------------------------------------------------------

[2023-06-09 17:20:00] #operations:risk-management
@achan:
@david.thompson absolutely, I'll make sure to include that in the full report. I've already started looking into it and it seems like most of the claims are related to slips and falls in the warehouse. We may need to review our safety protocols and consider additional training for staff.
