Hi David, I had a question about the new customer feedback system. Can we schedule a training session for the team to ensure everyone is comfortable using it?

@david.thompson:
Jenny, I saw that you posted about the employee engagement survey. Can we also include a section on customer-facing employee feedback? I think it would be valuable to hear their thoughts on our service standards.

@jlee:
Hi team, I've finished analyzing our Q3 2024 employee metrics. One key takeaway is that our average employee tenure has increased to 3.5 years, which is a 10% increase from the same period last year. This suggests that our employee retention efforts are paying off. I'll be sharing the full report in our next team meeting, but wanted to give you all a sneak peek.

@david.thompson:
@jlee Great to hear that our employee tenure is increasing! What do you think are the main factors contributing to this trend?
------------------------------------------------------------

@jlee:
@david.thompson From my analysis, it seems that our improved training programs, enhanced benefits, and increased opportunities for career growth have all played a role in keeping employees engaged and committed to the company. I'll have more details in the full report, but these are some of the key drivers I've identified so far.
