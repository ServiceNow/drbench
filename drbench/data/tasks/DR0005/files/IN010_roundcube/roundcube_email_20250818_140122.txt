Message Body:
----------------------------------------
Hi David,

I've compiled the customer service metrics for Q2 2024. One key highlight is the average resolution rate of customer inquiries via chat. Our data shows that 85% of customer inquiries were resolved via chat within 30 minutes. This is a significant improvement from Q1 and demonstrates the effectiveness of our chatbot in addressing customer concerns.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best,
Samantha

Hi David,

The most common inquiries resolved via chat were related to order tracking, product availability, and return policies. Our chatbot's ability to provide quick and accurate responses to these types of inquiries has significantly improved the customer experience.

I've attached a detailed breakdown of the inquiry types for your reference.
